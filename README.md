# PROJECT NAME

## Description

_Duration: 2 Days_

In this project I aimed to create a web app to compile student feedback regarding daily lessons.

In order to accomplish this goal I built a React single page app. I used a hash router to switch between page views and styled the app with Material UI. For each page I allowed users to continue to the next page only after feedback was given by conditionally rendering the link to the next page.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Installation

1. Create a database named `prime_feedback`,
2. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!
